        <p style="color:azure;text-align:center;font-family:courier;">Surprisingly there is a lot
        of life in the arctic waters. Larger predators like Orca live among these waters and Narwhal
        can also be seen. The Orca are mighty hunters and aggressive towards most they encounter.
        Local fisherman often report angry Orca capsizing their boats or working together to steal fish.
        <br>Narwhall are much kinder and will often bring gifts to those that visit the sea often. They
        use seaweed and algae to fashion fancy costumes and ornaments for their long tusks.
        <br> Some popular psychics and marine biologists have reported telepathic communication with elder
        Narwhals. Little is known aboout these conversations but Narwhals are rumored to gossip a lot.

 <p style="color:azure;text-align:center;font-family:courier">A lesser known creature is the Sea Angel
          which is a tiny but fierce little animal. (seen below)
          <br>Don't let their cute name and innocent appearance fool you. These small creatures are truly evil.
          They use their charm to entice their prey before quickly and efficiently gobbling them up whole.
          <br><b>A truly vicious display of their cruel nature.</b>
          <br>Not only are these creatures cunning, they are also super fast and use their smll fins
          to propel themselves through the water at lightning fast speeds.</p>
