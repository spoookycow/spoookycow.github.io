        <p style="color:azure;text-align:center;font-family:courier;">One day a young girl went to the ocean
        and explored the various tide pools. She found lots of interesting and fantastical creatures. One small
        pool even had some pirate glass buried beneath the sand. The entire experience instantly transfixed her 
        mind and she was forever obsessed with the ocean and it's wonders.
        <br>She would eventually grow up but her love for the ocean never ended. She spent her early adulthood
        exploring coastal waters and working as a marine biologist. During this time she would collect many items
        from her travels. Shown above is a collection of some of these small beachy trinkets.

          <br>Handcrafted felt whale sharks, from the time she swam with them.
          <br>Tiny toy seashells which remind her of Hawaii.
          <br>Handmade fish from the time she taught the locals in Fiji how to crochet.</p>
   <p style="color:azure;font-family:courier;text-align:center">I am that girl. This blog is a collection of my knowledge
          and some of the things I've experienced on my journeys.</p>
