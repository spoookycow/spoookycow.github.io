<p style="color:azure;font-family:courier;">A wide variety of fish live along the ocean floor.<br>
   There are <b>colorful</b> and <b>vibrant</b> fish that paint the seafloor in many different colors. <br>
   Curious crustaceons are also there too, resembling tiny creatures from space.
   <br>Many don't know this, but coral reefs are actually thriving communities and city centers
   for many different fish. They elect mayors and city council members. There are brave, bold fish that serve as the protectors
   for others. Younger fish actually do go to school together and they can even go to university.
   <br>Although life can be hard in the ocean, the fish that live among coral reef enjoy a wonderful sense of community and belonging.
   They work together to achieve their goals and better the health of the reef and the ocean.</p>
