<p style=color:azure;font-family:courier;text-align-last:center;>There have been<br>
    <b><i>certain reports...</i></b><br>of strange sightings at lower depths. Sightings that seem to suggest there may be
     some truth to the old fairytales and myths about the ocean.

These reports come from allover the world. Most accounts suggest that these creatures are
friendly however they are carnivorous. They seem to form bonds with dolphins, sharks, and
other larger marine life.</p>
<h2 style=color:yellowgreen;font-family:courier;>Other Species</h2>
<p style=color:azure;font-family:courier;text-align-last:center;>Here is a collection of sketches by an avid merfolk scholar, 
artist, and historian. As you can see there are many different species with many differnt features that define them.
<br>For example some do not have regular fins but instead tentacles or extra appendages. It would appear that their appearance
take on the characteristics and sizes of the fish they are most closely linked to. It can be seen that some arctic mermaid
exhibit behavior and even a tusk similar to the Narhwal.
<br> <b>It can also be noted that not all mermaid are friendly and some are even carnivorous, showing
    cannibalistic tendencies.</b></p>
